Welcome to my Profile Page. I am Matteo Gro√üe-Kampmann, and my research area is cybersecurity. I am appointed as a Professor for Distributed Systems at [Rhine-Waal University](https://www.hochschule-rhein-waal.de/de/user/9721).
This page is an ongoing effort to showcase some of my work. If you are interested in my research, this page is probably the right place. If you are interested in professional cybersecurity services and research, please look into [AWARE7](https://aware7.com).
Whoever wonders why my profile name is Lord Rupert Everton should rewatch "The Office."
